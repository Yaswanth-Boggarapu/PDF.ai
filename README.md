How to Use

Upload PDF: Click the "Upload a PDF" button and select the PDF file you want to analyze.
Ask Questions: Enter your question in the text input field and click "Submit."
View Response: The bot will process the query and provide a relevant answer based on the uploaded PDF.
Configuration

Pinecone Index: The code uses the default index name "default". You can customize this by modifying the pinecone.Index("default") line in the preprocess_and_store_pdf function.
Cohere Model: Adjust the model parameter in the co.generate call to use a different Cohere model if desired.
Additional Notes

Ensure you have a Pinecone index created and your API keys configured correctly.
For production deployment, consider using a container orchestration platform like Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
Customize the code to fit your specific requirements, such as adding more features or improving the response generation.
